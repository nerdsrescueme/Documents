Your Audience
-------------

It's time to define your target audience(s). Pin-pointing this target demo/psycographically allows us to determine what they want, need and expect. This information is invaluable in ways far exceeding the scope of this document, but for the purposes of this design brief it;

* Allows us to gather information about the audience whom you are targeting
* Give us insight into the mindset of the audience
* Allows us to more accurately target those most likely to buy/use your product
* Gives us an idea of who we are _not_ trying to reach, providing clarity
