Testimonial Resources {#resources}
----------------------------------

There are numerous resources available to help you develop a plan for gathering testimonials. The most valuable resource I have found is "[The Referral Engine](http://amzn.to/xCTV4o)" e-book, by John Jantsch. This book details how to set up a referral engine that allows you to drive your business based solely on referrals. John Jantsch is the creator of another useful book called "[Duct Tape Marketing](http://amzn.to/w6yZz4)." This book is equally useful in finding low cost ways to market your website.
