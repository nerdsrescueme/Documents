Selecting the Right Testimonials {#select}
------------------------------------------

### Be a curator {#curate}

As your testimonial library grows, you will be able to select specific testimonials to fit your potential customer's situation. Your customer stories most likely have similarities, even if they are abstract. Focus on the specific needs of your potential customers. Once you target their specific needs, use your testimonials to tell your story;

> I have solved your problem in the past and I can do it again. Here is my proof!

If you don't have the time or capability of catering testimonials to a specific customer, then choose the testimonials that best address the collective needs of your target audience.


### Less is more {#less}

You don't need 30 testimonials cycling through your website to prove that you can do what you say. 8-12 solid testimonials will be enough to convince any researcher that you have what it takes to get the job done. Too many testimonials may even seem in-genuine  to some. It could seem like infomercial marketing, too good to be true.

Instead of overwhelming your potential customer with a million testimonials, give them a few that will best match their specific needs. This sale is about them, not your past clients.
