Using Testimonials In Your Website Marketing {#intro}
-----------------------------------------------------

### What is a testimonial really?

> [tes-ti-mo-ni-al](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/testimonial) [tes-tuh-moh-nee-uh'l] n.
> 1. a written declaration certifying to a person's character, conduct, or qualifications, or to the value, excellence, etc., of a thing; a letter or written statement of recommendation.
> 2. something given or done as an expression of esteem, admiration, or gratitude

This definition demonstrates the power of a testimonial. As a statement of esteem, it is a beacon to potential customers that says "You can trust us, but don't just take my word for it." A testimonial builds trust in potential customers, breaking down pieces of the barrier between the customer and your product.


### What does it mean to receive a testimonial?

When you receive a testimonial, the writer is lending you the trust s/he has developed towards you. Handing you a testimonial is akin to a direct referral, but on a broader scale. S/he is saying; "I trust you to do for others, what you have done for me."

To hold the trust of others in your hands is a large responsibility. You should treat this duty with care and respect. Every potential customer that views that testimonial is borrowing trust from the writer. It's your job to make sure that trust is justified each and every time.
