<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>A design brief is a document which outlines the overall aesthetic and organizational goals of your project. It is meant to be a guiding document capable of cementing decisions early as a reference guide for later use. Functionally, this document provides the following benefits to the project as a whole;</p>

<ul>
<li>Provides insight into your organization</li>
<li>Provides insight into your target audience</li>
<li>Defines key project goals</li>
<li>Guides future decision making</li>
</ul>

<h3>Provides insight into your organization</h3>

<p>This document identifies your organizations' vision, values and ideals. The project will need to embody these, as all aspects of your business should. Naturally, we need to inject the specific needs of your organization into the goals of the project.</p>

<h3>Provides insight into your target audience</h3>

<p>This document identifies your target audience(s). The decisions we make for the project must satisfy their needs. The project must be compatible with your audience(s) in every way. We need to temper each decision against the specific needs of the audience we wish to target.</p>

<h3>Defines the key project goals</h3>

<p>The project has a distinct purpose. We need to identify that purpose and capture it within this document. The purpose will provide a stable platform for the numerous decisions which need to be made.</p>

<h3>Guides future decision making</h3>

<p>There are many pieces involved in the project, each requiring many decisions to be made. Any creative project will spark a flow of ideas and creativity that can be overwhelming, making it very easy to lose sight of what needs to be accomplished. The job of this document is to create a keystone for the decision making process. Using this document to guide the the process will save time, sanity and yield a cohesive end result.</p>

<h2 id="organization">Your Organization</h2>

<p>Let's get to know your organization. Understanding the collective "you" is critical to the design/development process. No coherent branding effort, marketing message or design product can be created without first understanding the organization for whom it is created. Only through this understanding can a designer/developer even begin to create a product that is a fit for your organization.</p>

<h3 id="mission">Mission</h3>

<p>Your mission statement was undoubtedly created to allow your audience to quickly grasp the values unique to your organization. The mission statement gives us insight into the image you wish to represent.</p>

<div data-type="editable">

<p>{Company mission statement}</p>

</div>

<h3 id="vision">Vision</h3>

<p>Your company vision statement provides more information beyond the traditionally short <a href="#mission">mission statement</a>. It allows us to further understand your organizations values.</p>

<p>{Company vision statement}</p>

</div>

<h3 id="products-services">Products &amp; Services</h3>

<p>After first understanding "you" we must then understand your product.</p>

<div data-type="editable">

<p>{Company products and services}</p>

</div>

<h3 id="peers">Competitive, Partner and Peer Organizations</h3>

<p>To understand "you" we need to understand your unique position in the marketplace. Understanding your competition, strategic partners and peers provides us with an idea of where you position yourself within your target market. Understanding this positioning is key in developing graphics and copy that really speaks to your target audience. All relevant organizations represent one or more of the following relationships to you;</p>

<ul>
<li>They have a similar model or values</li>
<li>They share your target audience</li>
<li>They provide similar a similar product</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="audience">Your Audience</h2>

<p>It's time to define your target audience(s). Pin-pointing this target demographically allows us to determine what they want, need and expect. This information is invaluable in ways far exceeding the scope of this document, but for the purposes of this design brief it;</p>

<ul>
<li>Allows us to gather information about the audience whom you are targeting</li>
<li>Give us insight into the mindset of the audience</li>
<li>Allows us to more accurately target those most likely to buy/use your product</li>
<li>Gives us an idea of who we are <em>not</em> trying to reach, providing clarity</li>
</ul>

<p>For the purposes of this document we are limiting this list to your <em>3 most important</em> audiences. This list may be organized in a number of ways, by;</p>

<h3 id="constraints">Constraints</h3>

<p>The term "constraint" usually indicates a very negative conversation. In the context of a website, it is a very important aspect of any project. Because of the ever-evolving and fast paced nature of the web, it is very easy to over-reach. Having a grasp on the projects constraints allows us to work within predefined parameters. This allows us to complete the project on time and on budget.</p>
